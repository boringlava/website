I am a [PhD student in the Department of Geosciences at Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/geosciences/people/grad-students.php) in Stony Brook, New York. My dissertation focuses on clumped isotope paleoclimate records from Miocene soil carbonates, from the Turkana Basin, Kenya. I am a member of the [Henkes Lab](https://sites.google.com/stonybrook.edu/thehenkeslab) and a collaborator on the [Turkana Miocene Project](http://turkanamiocene.com).
