Apps hosted on [shinyapps.io](shinyapps.io) can't be displayed on published Rmarkdown pages. This is an intentional limitation of shinyapps, to prevent overuse by bots that might crawl a public page elsewhere. An app can be embedded in an Rmarkdown document, as a frame linked to the app, or as embedded Shiny code if the Rmarkdown file won't be used to generate a static page. For use with Hugo, I'd have to host my apps somewhere other than [shinyapps.io](shinyapps.io) in order to embed them here. 

Alternatively, I can link to my apps from my site, and save time incorporating them into my pages and rebuilding. 

My first app uses the RStudio sample Shiny code, with the GNIP data instead of "Old Faithful" sample data.
