<p><strong>(in progress)</strong></p>
<p>This is a collection of links to basic Shiny apps using data from the <a href="http://www-naweb.iaea.org/napc/ih/IHS_resources_gnip.html">Global Networks of Isotopes in Precipitaion (IAEA/WMO, 2020)</a>. Apps are hosted on <a href="shinyapps.io">shinyapps.io</a>, and some of the code can be found across <a href="https://github.com/saslaw/">my GitHub repos</a>.</p>

<h2>Level 0</h2>
<p>My very first app uses the RStudio sample Shiny code to create an adjustable histogram, with data from GNIP instead of “Old Faithful” sample data. This demonstrates a deployed app using data from a .csv included in the app folder.</p>

<div id="time-series-and-x-y" class="section level2">
<h2>Time series and x-y</h2>
<p>After trying out a few more basic concepts, I wrote this app using ggplot code from my previous post. Users can filter by country and date range, choose a y-axis for a time series plot, and choose axis variables for an x-y plot.</p>
