<p><strong>(in progress)</strong></p>
<p>Apps hosted on <a href="shinyapps.io">shinyapps.io</a> can’t be displayed on published Rmarkdown pages. This is an intentional limitation of shinyapps, to prevent overuse by bots that might crawl a public page elsewhere. An app can be embedded in an Rmarkdown document, as a frame linked to the app, or as embedded Shiny code if the Rmarkdown file won’t be used to generate a static page. For use with Hugo, I’d have to host my apps somewhere other than <a href="shinyapps.io">shinyapps.io</a> in order to embed them here.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I can link to my apps from my site, and save time incorporating them into my pages and rebuilding.</p>
<p>My first app uses the RStudio sample Shiny code, with the GNIP data instead of “Old Faithful” sample data.</p>
