This is a collection of links to basic Shiny apps using data from the [Global Networks of Isotopes in Precipitaion (IAEA/WMO, 2020)](http://www-naweb.iaea.org/napc/ih/IHS_resources_gnip.html). Apps are hosted on [shinyapps.io](shinyapps.io), and some of the code can be found across [my GitHub repos](https://github.com/saslaw/).

## Level 0

My very first app uses the RStudio sample Shiny code to create an adjustable histogram, with data from GNIP instead of "Old Faithful" sample data. This demonstrates a deployed app using data from a .csv included in the app folder.

## Time series and x-y 

After trying out a few more basic concepts, I wrote this app using ggplot code from my previous post. Users can filter by country and date range, choose a y-axis for a time series plot, and choose axis variables for an x-y plot.
