This is a collection of links to basic Shiny apps using the [GNIP data set (IAEA/WMO, 2020)](https://nucleus.iaea.org/wiser). Apps are hosted on [shinyapps.io](shinyapps.io), and the code can be found across [my GitHub repos](github.com/saslaw).

## Level 0

My first app uses the RStudio sample Shiny code to create an adjustable histogram, with data from GNIP instead of "Old Faithful" sample data. This demonstrates a deployed app using data from a .csv included in the app folder. 

[See histogram with a single variable](https://saslaw.shinyapps.io/GNIP-Level0/)

## Level 1

I created an app to display the data in a table. There are widgets for filtering the data but they aren't implemented yet. The formatting of this page for viewing data could be improved.
