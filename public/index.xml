      <description>Viewing data I’ve downloaded a small set of data from the International Atomic Energy Agency Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation that includes water isotope data collected in the last 10 years from 14 sites around the world. With this data source, I can’t pull directly, but I can convert and load a .csv. The code chunk that produces this table also cleans up the data for display.</description>

      <description>(in progress)
This is a post about creating a website using Hugo, GitHub, and blogdown for Rmarkdown. There are a number of approaches to this setup, where it starts and which tools to use specifically. My approach is based on prior experience with static site generators, markdown, GitHub, and RStudio.
Phase One Acceptance I was due for making another work website, and I started with the most obvious option — I made a Wordpress site on my school’s hosting platform.</description>
