      <description>This is a post about creating a website using Hugo, GitHub, and blogdown for Rmarkdown. There are a number of approaches to this setup, where it starts and which tools to use specifically. My approach is based on prior experience with static site generators, markdown, GitHub, and RStudio. The GitHub repo for this site contains a more detailed history.

This is a collection of links to basic Shiny apps using the GNIP data set (IAEA/WMO, 2020). Apps are hosted on shinyapps.io, and the code can be found across my GitHub repos.
Level 0 My first app uses the RStudio sample Shiny code to create an adjustable histogram, with data from GNIP instead of “Old Faithful” sample data. This demonstrates a deployed app using data from a .</description>

      <description>Rnotebook setup This notebook requires a few R packages, listed and loaded below:
pacman::p_load(here, knitr, blogdown, tidyverse, lubridate, kableExtra, ggthemes)  Viewing data I’ve downloaded a small set of data from the International Atomic Energy Agency Global Network for Isotopes in Precipitation that includes water isotope data collected in the last 15 years from 7 sites around the world. The code chunk that produces this table also cleans up the data for display.</description>
